## About me

Hi there ðŸ‘‹. Iâ€™m Zain, a skilled and results-driven Frontend Developer with a strong background in Frontend development and a passion for crafting high-quality websites and web applications. With a keen eye for quality and a deep understanding of the Frontend ecosystem, I build solutions that are not only functional but also delightful. Besides my 9to5, I love to give back to the community by blogging, speaking, and open-sourcing my ideas. My love for community led me to Developer Expert for Frontend community. If Iâ€™m not crafting web/web appa then probably wondering about the universeâ€™s existence.
